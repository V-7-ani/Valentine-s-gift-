                Baby happy Valentine's Day 💘 <br>
                You see, I was making this for you. I know it's a bit amateurish, forgive me 😭 <br>
                but I was thinking about this for a while, so I made this for you. <br>
                I hope you like it and it will be a good and beautiful memory for you, baby. <br>
                And hey, I love you. Be mine always, okay? ❤️ <br>
                This is our second Valentine's after all! Next year's Valentine, I will try to make it even more memorable 🫂.

                Congratulations 🎉🎉 on passing, baby girl! I always knew you could do it. 🫂🫂 <br>
                You will pass like this with flying colors, I know! <br>
                Anyways, I will not take your time too much—you have to talk with me as well after all 😂 <br>
                So yeah, I love you baby 💕.
